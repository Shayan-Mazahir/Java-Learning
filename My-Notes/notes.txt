1. For classes, we use Pascal Convention. The first and Subsequent characters from a word are capital letters (uppercase).
    Example: Main, MyScanner, MyEmployee, CodeWithHarry

    For functions and variables, we use camelCaseConvention. Here the first character is lowercase, and the subsequent characters are uppercase like myScanner, myMarks, CodeWithHarry

2.  You can use a snakecase though its not recommended to use, it will probably work without any problem

3.  Adding either an L or an f for literals is a "java" thing (refer to convo in Programmers hangout: https://canary.discord.com/channels/244230771232079873/244238304613105664/1256643829444902955)

4.  double is 64 bits, float is 32 bits - main differnece between float and double

5.  new Scanner for input basically means that we are taking the template of the object "Scanner" and then making our own copy of that object/template to use. 

6.  for the new scanner the variable name can be anything, suppose it like a tree, with the variable being the stem of the tree and the places it is being used are the branches of that tree

7.  the HAS basically does what it says, it checks if the input or variavle has what we want it to be (validity of the program)
8.  next() only reads the words befreo the space, nextLine() reads pretty much everything
