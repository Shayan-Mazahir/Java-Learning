1. For classes, we use Pascal Convention. The first and Subsequent characters from a word are capital letters (uppercase).
    Example: Main, MyScanner, MyEmployee, CodeWithHarry

    For functions and variables, we use camelCaseConvention. Here the first character is lowercase, and the subsequent characters are uppercase like myScanner, myMarks, CodeWithHarry

2.  You can use a snakecase though its not recommended to use, it will probably work without any problem

3.  Adding either an L or an f for literals is a "java" thing (refer to convo in Programmers hangout: https://canary.discord.com/channels/244230771232079873/244238304613105664/1256643829444902955)

4.  double is 64 bits, float is 32 bits - main differnece between float and double

5.  new Scanner for input basically means that we are taking the template of the object "Scanner" and then making our own copy of that object/template to use. 

6.  for the new scanner the variable name can be anything, suppose it like a tree, with the variable being the stem of the tree and the places it is being used are the branches of that tree

7.  the HAS basically does what it says, it checks if the input or variavle has what we want it to be (validity of the program)

8.  next() only reads the words befreo the space, nextLine() reads pretty much everything

9.  % = Modulo and gives us the remainder 

10. && = your fav, the and operator and || = or

11. Result = byte + short -> integer
    Result = short + integer -> integer
    Result = long + float -> float
    Result = integer + float -> float
    Result = character + integer -> integer
    Result = character + short -> integer
    Result = long + double -> double
    Result = float + double -> double

12. Java does not read input as a Character, it will always be a String, use charAt() and use the string as list

13. For pretty formating we can use printf, there is no such thing as printlnf.. for a new line u need to use \n within the "" before u give the variable name. the different variable and how to use are:
    %d = integer
    %f = float and double (use %.15f or something for decimal places)
    %c = character
    %s = string

14. String function/types
    .trim() is used to remove whitespaces
    .substring(intital value, endng value) number ofc be int
    .replace('character_1', 'character_2') replaces 1 with 2
    .startsWith("string/character") true if its same
    .endsWith("string"/character) true if ends same
    .charAt() character at.. works like a list for string
    .indexOf("character", number of index) sees when thet character/string is starting from the index provided, so if the string is "Raza" and indexOf('a', 2) would give 3, and indexOf('a', 1) would give 1
    .lastIndexOf("string/character", number of index) so if the string is "Raza" and lastIndexOf("az", 3) the output would be 1, so it checks before the index 3... like Raza it checks from left to right 3 2 1 0
    .equals("string"/'character') checks if its equal to the same thing
    .equalsIgnoreCase() does the same thing as before just ingores any case
